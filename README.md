## Summary

This visualization explores the results of a segment of Britain's electricity market. The Short-term Operating Reserve (STOR) market serves the purpose of making stand-by power generation capacity available to cover, at a short notice (20 min to 240 min), possible electricity shortfalls. STOR auctions are run approximately once per quarter. There are two types of participants in the market, so-called Balancing and Non-Balancing ones. The former are usually conventional, fossil-fuel power plants and the latter - more flexible resources, such as demand-side response. The visualization explores the relative pricing and sizes of the cleared bids of the two types of players and shows that the Balancing type are generally priced higher in terms of both availability and utilization prices and also come in bigger MW sizes.

## Feedback 

Feedback1: 

_Looking at your web link, I like the format of your graphs and the way you can select them by season. From a use perspective, they can be difficult to read when there are many circles and they overlap, especially without any gridlines for reference. National Grid might say they do present their data in a lot of detail, including graphically already eg the STOR Market information reports. I think youâ€™d have to show and explain how your presentation of this data is better and provides additional benefits.

Feedback2:

_I like the interactivity by seasons and the way you have broken data by tender rounds. You may want to crystallize the key message, the key takeaway, more effectively.
